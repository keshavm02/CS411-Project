We considered Node and Django initially, and then finally decided to go with Node. Since for this assignment we only had to make a simple API call and render the result, we didn't want to build a whole bulky backend framework in Python's Django. It would have been too much trouble connecting the frontend and backend through RESTful decoupling, and we also didn't want to deal with the CORS errors for such a trivial task. Hence, we handled the API calls through Node itself, and used Pug (template engine) to render the result.
